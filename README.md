In this challenge, I will create an inventory management system for a small business. The system will handle the storage of product information, calculate stock levels, check for low inventory, and track sales. I will use objects to represent products, arrays to store the inventory, and control structures to manage stock checks and updates.

Scenario: A local electronics store wants to automate its inventory management. The store manager needs a system that tracks products in the inventory, updates stock levels after sales, and alerts when stock levels are low. Additionally, the system should calculate the total value of the remaining stock for each product type.
